# courseraCourse
This repo contains files for peer review for courses I complete over Coursera.

## Current course - Android Application Development (Project Oriented)

The repo contans two files:
  ### -/AndroidAplicationDevelopment/chatAppProtoType_v1.2.pdf
     This pdf file contains the prototype of the application.  
     The pdf file needs to be downloaded and opened on the local computer to play with the application's flow interactively.
     
  ### -/AndroidAplicationDevelopment/chatAppProtoType_v1.2.epgz
     This is the Pencil (https://pencil.evolus.vn/) project file.<tr>
     Pencil is an awesome tool to make a blue print interacitve prototype. 
     It helps to really cement the idea of an application before the final coding is performed.
